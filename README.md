## Requirements
This code was developed and tested on:   
MATLAB Version: 9.13.0.2126072 (R2022b) Update 3  
Operating System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 10.0 (Build 26100)


## Usage 
The entry point is runNeckSims. This script is the driver for running acoustic and thermal simulations.  
Start by modifying the SETUP section with data directories, information about the segmented model,  
desired transducer positions, ERFA file information, etc.
