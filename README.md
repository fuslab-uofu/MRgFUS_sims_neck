# MRgFUS_sims_neck

Collection of MATLAB scripts and functions for reproducing data published in   
"Ablation of cervical facet joints is safe and feasible with two magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound transducers as demonstrated by thermal simulations"  
[citation]


## Requirements
This code was developed and tested on:   
MATLAB Version: 9.13.0.2126072 (R2022b) Update 3  
Operating System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 10.0 (Build 26100)


## Usage 
The entry point is runNeckSims. This script is the driver for running acoustic and thermal simulations.  
Start by modifying the SETUP section with data directories, information about the segmented model, 
desired transducer positions, ERFA file information, etc.
